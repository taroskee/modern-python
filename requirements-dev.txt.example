# Personal development libraries template
# 
# How to use:
# 1. Copy this file to requirements-dev.txt
#    cp requirements-dev.txt.example requirements-dev.txt
# 
# 2. Add your personal libraries below
# 
# 3. The libraries will be automatically installed when:
#    - You start the DevContainer
#    - You run scripts/setup.sh
#    - You run: uv pip sync requirements-dev.txt
# 
# Note: requirements-dev.txt is in .gitignore, so your personal settings won't be committed
